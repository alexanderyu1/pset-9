    <h2> Rules </h2>

      <h3> <a href="tictactoe.html"> Tic Tac Toe </a> </h3>
      <br>
        <p> The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. </p>
        <p> You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns
          putting their marks in empty squares. </p>
        <p>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. </p>
        <p> When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> <a href="ultimate.html"> Ultimate Tic Tac Toe </a> </h3>
      <br>
        <p> Each small 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board is referred to as a local board,
          and the larger 3-by-3 board is referred to as the global board. </p>
        <p> The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots.
          This move 'sends' their opponent to its relative location. For example, if
          X played in the top right square of their local board, then O needs to
          play next in the local board at the top right of the global board. O can
          then play in any one of the nine available spots in that local board, each
          move sending X to a different local board. </p>
        <p>If a move is played so that it is to win a local board by the rules of
          normal tic-tac-toe, then the entire local board is marked as a victory
          for the player in the global board. </p>
        <p> Once a local board is won by a player or it is filled completely,
          no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such
          a board, then that player may play in any other board. </p>
        <p> Game play ends when either a player wins the global board or there
           are no legal moves remaining, in which case the game is a draw. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> <a href="connectfour.html"> Connect Four </a> </h3>
      <br>
        <p> Disks are dropped into an empty connect four game board. players take alternating turns. </p>
        <p> The player that places four of their disks in a row first wins. The four disks can be vertial, horizontal,
          or diagonal, as long as there are four in a row. </p>
